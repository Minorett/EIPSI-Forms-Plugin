hotfix(v1.2.2): automatic database schema repair - zero data loss guarantee

CRITICAL: Prevents "Unknown column" INSERT errors during form submissions

Problem:
- Installations upgrading from v1.0/v1.1 to v1.2+ had missing database columns
- Form submissions failed silently with "Unknown column 'participant_id'" errors
- Clinical research data was lost despite database being operational
- Researchers unable to fix without manual SQL commands

Solution - 3-Layer Protection System:

Layer 1: Activation Hook (Fresh Installations)
- Enhanced vas_dinamico_activate() to set eipsi_db_schema_version = '1.2.2'
- Added activation logging for debugging
- File: vas-dinamico-forms.php (+5 lines)

Layer 2: Auto-Repair on Load (Existing Installations)
- New EIPSI_Database_Schema_Manager::repair_local_schema() method
- Triggered on plugins_loaded hook if schema version < 1.2.2
- Periodic verification on admin_init (max once per 24 hours)
- Silently adds missing columns and indices
- File: admin/database-schema-manager.php (+167 lines)
- File: vas-dinamico-forms.php (+11 lines for verification hook)

Layer 3: Emergency Fallback (AJAX Submit)
- Enhanced vas_dinamico_submit_form_handler() with error detection
- Detects "Unknown column" or "doesn't exist" errors in $wpdb->last_error
- Triggers emergency repair and retries INSERT once
- Logs all recovery operations to error_log
- File: admin/ajax-handlers.php (+47 lines)

Files Modified:
- vas-dinamico-forms.php: Version 1.2.2, activation hook, plugins_loaded verification
- admin/database-schema-manager.php: Auto-repair methods for local WordPress DB
- admin/ajax-handlers.php: Emergency fallback with retry logic

Tests:
- test-hotfix-v1.2.2-schema-repair.js: 48/48 tests passing (100%)
- Build: webpack 5.102.1 compiled successfully
