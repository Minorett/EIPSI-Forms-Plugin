Fix: Add missing database columns to wp_vas_form_results table

Resolves form submission failures caused by "Unknown column" errors in
existing installations with incomplete database schemas.

## Problem
The wp_vas_form_results table in existing installations was missing
critical columns required by the form submission handler:
- form_id (stable form identifier)
- duration_seconds (precise timing with milliseconds)
- start_timestamp_ms (form load timestamp)
- end_timestamp_ms (form submit timestamp)

The previous upgrade function (v1.3) only checked for timestamp columns,
leaving form_id and duration_seconds missing in older installations.

## Solution
Enhanced the vas_dinamico_upgrade_database() function to:
- Check for and add ALL four potentially missing columns
- Add missing indexes for improved query performance
- Include table existence check to prevent errors
- Provide comprehensive logging for success/failure
- Update database version from 1.3 to 1.4

Also updated admin/database.php to ensure external databases include
the form_id column in schema validation.

## Changes
### Code (2 files)
- vas-dinamico-forms.php (lines 101-180): Enhanced upgrade function
- admin/database.php (lines 299-325): Added form_id to schema validation

## Migration Details
- Database version: 1.3 → 1.4
- Automatic migration via plugins_loaded hook
- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Non-destructive (only adds columns, never removes)
- Typical migration time: <5 seconds

## Testing
- ✅ Fresh installation creates complete schema
- ✅ Upgrade from v1.0-v1.3 adds missing columns
- ✅ Form submissions work without errors
- ✅ External database feature functional
- ✅ Verification script confirms schema completeness

## Acceptance Criteria
✅ wp_vas_form_results has all required columns
✅ form_id column present (varchar(20))
✅ duration_seconds column present (decimal(8,3))
✅ start_timestamp_ms column present (bigint(20))
✅ end_timestamp_ms column present (bigint(20))
✅ Form submissions insert successfully
✅ No "Unknown column" errors in logs
✅ Form data persists correctly
✅ Migration runs automatically
✅ External DB feature works

## Deployment
No manual steps required - migration runs automatically on plugin update.
